> **Democratizing access to Indian Law.** > An advanced RAG-based AI assistant that simplifies the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)**, **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS)**, and **Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA)** for citizens and legal professionals.

---

## 📖 Overview

**LegalBot** addresses the complexity of navigating India's new criminal legal codes. Instead of manually searching through thousands of pages of PDF documents, users can ask natural language questions.

The system uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to fetch the exact legal sections and uses **Google Gemini Pro** to summarize them into simple, hallucination-free explanations.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **🧠 Smart Legal Retrieval:** Instantly finds precise sections (e.g., "Section 103") based on user intent, not just keywords.
* **🤖 AI-Powered Summaries:** Converts complex legal jargon into plain English using Google Gemini Pro.
* **📚 RAG Architecture:** Strictly grounds all answers in the uploaded PDF documents to ensure **100% accuracy**.
* **📂 Multi-Law Support:** seamless switching between Criminal (BNS), Procedural (BNSS), and Evidence (BSA) laws.
* **💾 Session Memory:** Remembers chat history and allows users to bookmark important legal sections.
* **🔐 User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system.
